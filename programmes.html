                                    <p>Teesta Stage VI Hydro Electric Project was allotted to LancoTeesta Hydro Power Limited (LTHPL) (Erstwhile known as Lanco Energy Private Limited), wholly own subsidiary of LancoInfratech Limited. Project capacity was enhanced from 350 MW to 500 MW after shifting the dam location and further study made by the LTHPL. The project is a run of the river hydroelectric power project across the Teesta river. The project site is located at SubinKhore, in the southern part of Sikkim. The project is a part of the overall development of the Teesta basin being undertaken by the Government of Sikkim (GoS). The project’s design energy was 2,441 million units at plant load factor of about 56% and 250 million units of secondary energy (based on 90% dependable year).Design Energy is now revised to 2338 MU’s based on revised Hydrology study carried out by LTHPL.</p>
                                    <p>Implementation Agreement The Company has entered into an Implementation Agreement (IA) with Government of Sikkim (GoS), which provides the company with the right to develop the Project to the Company. Further, as per the IA, for the initial 15-year period commencing from the date of commercial operations, 12 % of the energy generated would be offered to GoS free of charge as royalty payment, which would be increased to 15 % for the remaining years.</p>
                                    <p>Based on Detailed Project Report cost of Rs.2,997 Crores, Company executed Power Purchase Agreement with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited at a levelized tariff of Rs. 2.32/- KWh for 25 years.</p>
                                    <p>Project achieved financial closure from consortium of 9 lenders (ICICI bank being a lead lender) with apprised cost of Rs. 3,000 Crores with Debt Equity ratio of 80:20 and May 2012 as a Project Commercial Operation Date. LTHPL has awarded EPC contract to Lanco Infratech Limited under International Competitive Bidding.</p>
                                    <p>However, project could not achieve commercial operation as per schedule COD of May, 2012 mainly due to delay in handing over of site to EPC Contractor due to delayed clearance from Ministry of Environment &amp; Forest for diversion of forest land, geological surprises, change in design due to adverse site conditions. Due to delay, Project encountered with increase in Project cost which LTHPL was not able to achieve cost overrun funding mainly due to Fixed price PPA with MSEDCL. As such project lenders have stopped disbursing fund for project and construction activities were stopped since 2013.</p>
                                    <p>As per RBI Guideline project should achieve COD latest by May2016, beyond which asset classification in the books of lenders has to be downgraded. Further in June, 2015 RBI has come out with guideline on Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) whereby Lenders can convert it’s part of a debt so as to lenders collectively held 51% of paid up capital of The Company post conversion of debt by lenders. Lenders can get protection of 18 months from downgrading of Asset classification within which Change in Management of The borrower should happen. As per SDR guideline, Joint Lender Forum of the lenders have decided to invoke SDR and converted Rs. 698 Crores from it’s outstanding debt/overdue interest to Equity of LTHPL. As of June 2017, LTHPL’s paid up capital was around Rs. 1,368 Crores. Entire shareholding of the LTHPL held by Lanco Group Companies is under pledge with Lenders. Lenders have executed agreement whereby, Lenders have a right to sale, transfer the shares of LTHPL held by Lanco Group Companies in the manner they think it fit unless Lanco has better offer for the same. As on date, Lenders of Teesta are not able to identify New Promoter for Change In Management and protection to Asset Classification, which was available till January 2017 is no longer available.</p>

Viability of The Project is being established with a first year tariff of Rs. 3.75/- KWh and 1 % escalation year over year till 35th Year with design energy of 2338 Mus with the completed cost of Rs. 6,573 to the Company. Further project is expected to generate 250Mus of Secondary energy, which will be added to profitability of the Project. Project is expected to earn more than Rs. 4,500 Crores profit after tax at above tariff in concession period of 35 years. Project IRR is expected to be 11.65 % considering discount in acquisition of Equity and availment of concession requested from Lenders. Project will have saleable energy of 2,006 Mus and 1,938 Mus for first 15 years and for balance 20 years respectively after considering auxiliary consumption, transmission losses and royalty to State Government Agency. It is estimated that State Government Agency will get 10870 MUs by way of Royalty, which will give revenue of Rs. 4,900 Croresin Project life cycle of 35 years.</p>
